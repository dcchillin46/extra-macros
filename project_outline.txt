#                    *Project Outline*
#####################################################################

Goal:
	Assemble a list of macros for new (and lazy) users consisting of common functions and resources.  
When possible intgrating console and machine feedback to make printing easier to learn and enjoy.
	
	Including macros for:
		Common functions- i.e. Filament Load
		Resources- i.e. Klipper Docs
		Tuning- i.e. Extruder Calibration

As I learn to print I have found myself returning to the same sites repeatedly to find commands and processes. 
This project is a an attempt to create, where possible, "Easy Buttons" for common functions and processes. I have tried to itegrate console 
feedback to notify the users of macro purpose, process information, and macro progress to eliminate any confusing stalls that new users 
may experience (i.e. waiting for heater temp). Some of these commands also utilize a hardware beeper to further notify the user as well.

#	              Consistency Guidelines                    
#####################################################################

Keep macros as universal as possible. Callouts to spcific haardware or settings should be minimized
	When Required, notate/comment in code advising users how it may be changed to suite their hardware "#Remove this beeper line if not configured locally"

Utilize RESPOND command to provide console feedback
	Common prefixes:
		"Description:" an overview of the macro function or goal
		"Process:" when the message contains links to an established processes or equations (i.e. extruder calibration docs )
		"Macro:" provides feedback on current progress of the macro (i.e. waiting on heaters)

Minimize bloat and duplication of frontend features
	Printer lights are generally available on the dashboard, a macro is not necessary
	Additional macros for uncommon or specific temps can be made locally or use frontend 
	
Link to related documents
	Extruder calibration links to Ellis tuning guide page
	Preferably in console when possible or comment in .cfg

If you would like attribution feel free to comment your name by the macro header
